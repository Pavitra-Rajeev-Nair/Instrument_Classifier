# Instrument_Classifier
A music instrument classifier in real time using audio signals. 
The core of the project revolves around real time processing of audio signals to classify them into musical instruments. We extract features the audio signals using dsp techniques, train a machine learning mode to classify the instruments and present the results using a GUI.
